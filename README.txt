Guidelines/Instructions to run the demo code:
1. test_large folder contains 3000 documents and test_small folder contains the small 5 files data set
2. Run the IR_small.py for checking output on a small dataset of 5-10 documents. Please enter the path to files to be ranked in the format
   "/path/to/current_folder/test_small/*" and the path to query document as "/path/to/current_folder/query.txt"
3. Run the IR_large.py for checking output on large dataset of documents. Please enter the path to files to be ranked in the format
   "/path/to/current_folder/test_large/*". Here by default the first document read by the code is treated as the query document.

PS: The code may be tested on other datasets too provided the paths mentioned above are provided correctly by the user when prompted by
    the script.
